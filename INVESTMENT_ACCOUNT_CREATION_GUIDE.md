# Investment Account Creation Feature

## Overview
This document outlines the newly implemented Investment Account Creation feature for the GKash app. This feature allows users to create investment accounts through a guided multi-step flow that helps them select the right investment type based on their goals, risk tolerance, and financial situation.

## Architecture

### Data Layer
- **Location**: `app/src/main/java/com/example/g_kash/investment/data/InvestmentModels.kt`
- **Components**:
  - Investment account types (Money Market, Balanced Fund, Equity Fund, Bond Fund)
  - Investment goals (Wealth Building, Retirement, Education, etc.)
  - Risk tolerance levels (Conservative, Moderate, Aggressive)
  - Investment horizons (Short, Medium, Long term)
  - UI state management classes

### Presentation Layer
- **ViewModel**: `InvestmentAccountCreationViewModel.kt` - Manages the multi-step flow state and business logic
- **UI Screen**: `InvestmentAccountCreationScreen.kt` - Compose UI for the step-by-step flow

## Investment Account Types

| Type | Risk Level | Min Amount | Expected Return | Description |
|------|------------|------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Money Market Fund | Low | KES 1,000 | 8-12% annually | Conservative, high liquidity |
| Balanced Fund | Medium | KES 5,000 | 12-18% annually | Mix of stocks and bonds |
| Equity Fund | High | KES 10,000 | 15-25% annually | Stock market investments |
| Fixed Income Fund | Low | KES 2,500 | 10-15% annually | Government and corporate bonds |

## Multi-Step Flow

### Step 1: Investment Type Selection
- Users choose from the four available investment account types
- Each type shows risk level, minimum amount, expected returns, and features
- Visual cards with icons and risk level badges

### Step 2: Set Investment Goals
- Users select their primary investment goal:
  - Wealth Building
  - Retirement Planning
  - Education Funding
  - Home Purchase
  - Emergency Fund
  - Passive Income
- Users also select their investment horizon (Short/Medium/Long term)

### Step 3: Risk Assessment
- Users indicate their risk tolerance:
  - **Conservative**: Prefer stable returns with minimal risk
  - **Moderate**: Can accept some risk for better returns
  - **Aggressive**: Comfortable with high risk for potentially high returns

### Step 4: Initial Deposit
- Users set their initial investment amount
- Minimum amount validation based on selected account type
- Suggested amount chips for quick selection
- Real-time validation with user feedback

### Step 5: Review & Confirm
- Summary of all selections
- Final confirmation before account creation
- Loading state during account creation process

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¨ **Modern UI/UX**
- Material Design 3 components
- Progress indicator showing step completion
- Smooth transitions between steps
- Error handling with user-friendly messages
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

### ðŸ”§ **Robust Validation**
- Step-by-step validation prevents progression without required selections
- Minimum deposit validation based on account type
- Comprehensive error handling with clear feedback

### ðŸ“Š **Rich Visual Elements**
- Investment type cards with icons and risk badges
- Color-coded risk levels (Green/Orange/Red)
- Progress bar showing completion percentage
- Selectable cards with visual selection states

### ðŸ”„ **State Management**
- Comprehensive UI state tracking
- Navigation between steps with back/forward functionality
- Error state management
- Loading states during account creation

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Backend Integration
- Uses existing `AccountsRepository` for account creation
- Creates account via `CreateAccountRequest` with investment type
- Integrated with existing authentication and session management

### Dependency Injection
- Properly configured in Koin (`AppModule.kt`)
- ViewModel injection available throughout the app
- Repository dependencies automatically resolved

### Navigation Integration
Ready for integration with existing navigation system:
```kotlin
// Example navigation setup
InvestmentAccountCreationScreen(
    onNavigateBack = { navController.popBackStack() },
    onAccountCreated = { 
        // Navigate to success screen or dashboard
        navController.navigate("investment_success") {
            popUpTo("accounts") { inclusive = false }
        }
    }
)
```

## Code Structure

```
investment/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ InvestmentModels.kt        # Data models and enums
â””â”€â”€ presentation/
    â”œâ”€â”€ InvestmentAccountCreationViewModel.kt  # Business logic
    â””â”€â”€ InvestmentAccountCreationScreen.kt     # UI components
```

## Usage Example

### Basic Integration
```kotlin
@Composable
fun InvestmentFlow(navController: NavHostController) {
    InvestmentAccountCreationScreen(
        onNavigateBack = { navController.popBackStack() },
        onAccountCreated = { 
            // Handle successful account creation
            navController.navigate("investment_dashboard")
        }
    )
}
```

### Custom ViewModel Usage
```kotlin
class YourViewModel : ViewModel() {
    private val investmentViewModel = InvestmentAccountCreationViewModel(accountsRepository)
    
    fun observeInvestmentState() {
        investmentViewModel.uiState.collect { state ->
            // React to state changes
            when {
                state.isAccountCreated -> handleSuccess()
                state.error != null -> handleError(state.error)
                state.isLoading -> showLoading()
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Testing Considerations

### Unit Testing
- ViewModel logic can be tested independently
- State transitions and validation logic
- Error handling scenarios

### UI Testing
- Step navigation flow
- Input validation feedback
- Visual state changes

### Integration Testing
- Backend account creation
- Error scenarios (network failures, validation errors)
- Complete end-to-end flow

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Investment Calculator**: Help users calculate potential returns
2. **Risk Profile Questionnaire**: More detailed risk assessment
3. **Document Upload**: Support for identity verification documents
4. **Investment Goals Tracking**: Progress monitoring after account creation
5. **Multiple Account Support**: Allow users to create multiple investment accounts
6. **Educational Content**: In-flow tips and explanations about investment types

### Performance Optimizations
- Lazy loading of investment data
- Caching of user preferences
- Background account creation with offline support

## Accessibility Features
- Screen reader support with content descriptions
- High contrast mode compatibility
- Touch target sizing compliance
- Keyboard navigation support

## Security Considerations
- Sensitive data handling (investment amounts, personal preferences)
- Secure API communication for account creation
- Input validation and sanitization
- Session management integration

## Maintenance Notes
- Regular updates to investment types and expected returns
- Monitoring of conversion rates through the flow
- User feedback collection for UX improvements
- Performance monitoring for step transitions

This investment account creation feature provides a comprehensive, user-friendly way for users to set up investment accounts while ensuring they make informed decisions based on their financial goals and risk tolerance.
