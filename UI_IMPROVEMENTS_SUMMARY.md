## ðŸ”§ Key Improvements Made

### 2. Enhanced IntroductionCard

## ðŸŽ¨ Design Decisions

### Color Strategy
1. **Pink Primary**: Used for main action buttons (Invest Now)
2. **Gold Secondary**: Used for values, points, and company logo backgrounds
3. **Neutral Surfaces**: Clean white/gray cards that don't compete with content
4. **Subtle Disabled States**: Gray overlay for insufficient points without being harsh

### Typography Hierarchy
1. **Company names**: titleMedium, Bold
2. **Stock symbols**: bodyMedium, Regular
3. **Labels**: bodySmall, Medium weight for clarity
4. **Values**: bodyMedium, Bold for emphasis
5. **Points cost**: titleSmall, Bold for important financial info

### Interaction Design
- **Clear affordability states**: Visual distinction between can/cannot afford
- **Informative feedback**: Helpful text for insufficient points
- **Proper button sizing**: Compact but touchable action buttons
- **Lock icon**: Visual indicator for locked investments
